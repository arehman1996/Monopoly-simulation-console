Note: 

my program runs perfectly fine when opening the solution in visual studio and pressing f5 or "Local windows debugger" button

however, the executable file in the debug folder seems to encounter an error when trying to run

if the exe file also encounters an error for you then please unzip the the Monopoly Assignment folder and run the solution
